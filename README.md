# quotes

## Lab: 08 - OO Design and GSON

**This application** will read a JSON file which contain alot of quotes.. then each time this app will run, will print out one of these quotes randomly.

### Configuration
Java doesn't have it's own built-in JSON parser. We need to add a dependency on one Google built called GSON. Add this to your project dependencies in build.gradle.we editted the dependencies to add compile tp compile our json file to read from it .
